  <p class="muted">Hi there - and welcome!</p>
  <p>This site contains personal stories and reflections from my work as a Scrum Master, Agile Coach, and systems thinker. Occasionally, I also write about investing and markets.</p>

  <p><strong>None of this is financial advice.</strong> It’s for educational and informational purposes only. I’m not FCA-regulated. Please don’t invest based on anything here without doing your own research, and ideally consult a qualified financial adviser first.</p>
